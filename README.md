# StackOverflow Tag Prediction.
(case studies), Perform an analysis of StackOverflow questions to predict tags based on question content.

# Introduction
In this project, we aim to develop a system to predict tags for StackOverflow questions. This is a multi-label classification problem where a question may be associated with multiple tags. Our model will serve to automatically suggest tags when a user posts a question on StackOverflow. This could greatly enhance the user experience by easing the question posting process and improving the searchability of questions.

$Description
The project process can be divided into three main sections: data exploration and analysis, data preprocessing, and machine learning model implementation. Each section involves a variety of techniques and methodologies to analyze and visualize data, preprocess and transform text data, and train and evaluate machine learning models respectively.

$Technologies
This project is implemented with the following technologies:

1. Python: The main programming language used for the project.
2. SQLite: Used for storing and retrieving our preprocessed dataset.
3. Pandas: Used for data manipulation and analysis.
4. Sklearn: Provides various functions and classes for machine learning models and preprocessing.
5. Matplotlib, Seaborn: Used for visualizing data analysis results.
6. NLTK: Provides text processing libraries for classification, tokenization, stemming, and tagging.
   
# Features

1. Extensive data exploration and analysis.
2. Comprehensive data preprocessing including code-snippet extraction, special character removal, stop words removal, stemming, and more.
3. Implementation of various machine learning models including OneVsRest strategy with Linear-SVC, Binary Relevance method with Naive Bayes, OneVsRest with Logistic Regression, and Label Powerset method with Decision Tree.
4. Tuning of hyperparameters using GridSearchCV.
5. Performance evaluation of models using cross-validation and F1 Score.
   
# Dataset
The dataset used in this project is a large set of StackOverflow questions and their associated tags. It contains 4 million questions, but due to RAM memory limitations, we use only a 0.5 million sample for this project (From Kaggle).

# System Design
The project starts with loading the data from the SQLite database and performing initial data exploration and analysis. After understanding the dataset, extensive data preprocessing is performed to transform raw text data into a format suitable for machine learning. Once the data is prepared, it's split into a training and a testing set. Subsequently, various machine learning models are implemented and evaluated based on their F1 scores. Finally, the model with the best performance is selected for tag prediction.

# Conclusion and Next Steps
This project provides a comprehensive procedure to predict tags for StackOverflow questions. However, machine learning models can always be improved. The next steps could include trying out more advanced models or techniques, creating a web interface, implementing the model into a production environment, or improving preprocessing steps.

# How to Run the Project

Ensure that you have the necessary Python libraries installed (pandas, sklearn, sqlite3, etc.).
Clone or download the project repository.
If the 'final_data.db' database is not present, download it from (Kaggle)the StackOverflow data and perform the preprocessing steps as described above.
Run the Python scripts in the order they are listed in this README file.
Evaluate the models and use the one that best suits your needs.
